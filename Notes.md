# At the limits of our current agricultural system.

It is currently projected that by mid-century there will be 9 billion people living on this planet, which presents our generation with a great problem to solve: how will we manage to feed all those people without destroying the world?

This problem is especially disturbing given that:
1.  Our food production curve in the current agricultural paradigm exhibits linear growth, while our population exhibits *exponential* growth.
2.  Climate change will likely cause more intense drought, flooding, and famine in some parts of the world.
3.  The soils that grow our food are deteriorating. To feed 9 billion people, the UN estimates, 6m hectares (14.8m acres) of new farmland will be needed every year.
4.  Deforestation is happening at alarming rates, especially in poor tropical coutries. Bad agricultural practices lead to infertile lands, which leads to more burning.
5.  Crop irrigation uses significantly more water than any other human activity, approximately 70% of all human water use is for agriculture.
6.  Eating healthy is expensive (especially compared to junk food): In many parts of America, it is cheaper to buy a McDonalds hamburger than a head of broccoli.
7.  On top of all this 21,000 people die every day of hunger or hunger-related causes, according to the United Nations.

**We need to evolve our agricultural practices.**

To feed and save the world we need to grow MORE FOOD with less water, less land, less toxic chemicals, less transport distance, less suffering, less energy, less CO2, less hassle, less time, less waste, and less seasonality.

While this may sound highly idealistic, *it’s not*. Hydroponics, aquaponics, aeroponics, and other “new” methods of agriculture have been around for a long time. These technologies have many advantages over the current agricultural paradigmn:
●   Significantly less water use. Water is recycled.
●   Ideally suitable for vertical and indoor farming (less land use).
●   No need for herbicides.
●   Significantly less (or zero) pesticide use.
●   Food can be grown year round.
●   Food can be grown closer to where it will be consumed.
●   Higher yields.
●   Plants can be grown in sterile environments.
●   Reduced transport costs and emissions as food can be grown much closer to where it will be consumed.

We stand on the shoulders of giants.

Combinations of these technologies and synthesizing knowledge across a wide range of scientific fields will allow us to create the agricultural systems of tomorrow.

# The Future
With computer controlled environments, it will be possible to grow practically any type of living system virtually anywhere in the world (or out of this world) regardless of seasonality. We will be able collect massive ammounts of data about living organisms and their environments. We will know more about what is growing at any given time than has ever been known by the human race, allowing us to build more secure, distributed, sustainable, efficient, and productive agricultural systems than ever before.

We envision a future where growing plants will be as easy as insert seed, the computer knows what it is and grows it; a future where medicines normally found only in the Amazon rainforest can be grown in Scandinavia; where aquaponics can become an easy and inexpensive method of producing fish and plants; where restaurants grow specialty ingredients such as Morel Mushrooms or Saffron; where people grow a large amount of the food they eat in their homes; where old buildings can be easily (and cheaply) converted into vertical farms; where data scientists simulate drought conditions in computer controlled environments to breed more drought resistant crops…

To get there we need openly licensed core technology and standards that can effectively solve the basic problems, enabling people and hardware makers to specialize and move on to the real interesting possibilites and use cases:
●   Growing expensive spices like vanilla and saffron.
●   Growing medicinal plants.
●   Growing petri-dish “meat,” “cheese,” and “milk.”
●   Growing plants indoors in my house.
●   Growing algea for bio-fuel.

We want to make a future where medicines normally found only in the Amazon rainforest can be grown in Scandinavia, where aquaponics can become an easy and inexpensive method of producing fish and plants, where restaurants grow specialty ingredients such as Morel Mushrooms or Saffron, where people grow a large ammount of the food they eat in their homes, where data scientists simulate drought conditions in computer controlled environments to breed more drought resistent crops… etc.

## Challenges preventing adoption of Controlled Environment Agriculture
However, many challenges have prevented such systems from being more widely adopted. It is these challenges we strive to address: price, knowledge, and usability. 

Current hydroponic technology has often been designed by agricultural scientists for agricultural scientists in industrial settings (or people growing weed) and as such current designs have paid less attention to usability, data, automation, and aesthetics.

Hydroponics is hard, even with a simple kit, you still need to check the Ph, make sure the plants get enough light indoors, and monitor nutrient and water levels. Even still, this may not be enough to grow many types of plants as humidity and temperature are also important factors.

Moreover, it can also be difficult to find high quality information about constructing and setting up hydroponic systems.

This is an area of agriculture that is ripe for disruption. We aim to improve the design of hydroponic systems to make them easy to setup and run.  The key way we want to do this is through software and hardware that can control and monitor the growing environments of plants. 

#### Usability problems in agriculture
Many people want to grow plants, but don’t know how. It’s not as simple as put a seed in the ground and harvest a plant, take for example, the garlic plant. It grows underground, so how do you know that it’s ready unless you dig it up? More over when you dig it up, it doesn’t look like the garlic you get in stores.

The future of agriculture is deeply intertwined with an information problem, how to grow plants? It’s not exactly as if one size fits all. Sure you can make a automatic watering system, but that will not always be enough to get the outcomes people expect.

# Nature doesn't do 'One size fits all'
A bunch of smart plant growth systems are coming out, but they are all proprietary and non-interoperable. Thus, every startup, hobbiest, or business who wants to create controlled agricultural systems is forced to start from the bottom up. Which is a shame, because we’ve had automated hydrponics systems since the 80’s and you would think we’d be farther than merely growing herbs and basil. The real interesting possibilities are in more advanced use cases (such as growing vanilla, saffron, medicine, mushrooms, or algea).

But alas, many plants are not always so easy to grow. Living systems are afterall, complex and diverse. Some are large, some are small, some like it hot, and some like it cold, etc. Nature doesn’t do once size fits all.
